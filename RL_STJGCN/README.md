Reinforcement learning augmented implementation of spatio-temporal joint graph convolutional network 
for trading. Graph convolution operations are done in base python so this is far too slow.

If I return to this project ever I should consider writing these spatio-temporal joint graph 
convolution operations in numpy and try to figure out how to calculate the gradients manually (i.e. make
a Pytorch module)
